            </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>This is a simple website about my tech journey so far. I am an Ethical Hacking student with plans to major in Web-security.</p>
                    <p>
                        I started my cybersecurity journey in 2024. I signed up for a free cybersecurity cohort under Pora Tech academy. Although It is a tech academy based in Lagos, my classes were completely online. I successfully completed my 6 months basic introductory course in cybersecurity and was awarded a certificate of completion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;After my basic course, it was time to choose a path out of all the several cybersecurity paths out there. It was a tough one for me, I needed help. The number of cybersecurity careers was overwhelming, It was a hard pick. I juggled between picking the SOC analyst path or the Ethical hacking path so I had to seek help via research. I researched soft skills needed to excel in each paths, and realized I resonated more with Ethical Hacking.
                        It just had to be it. I made the choice to take this path and I'm still on it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Fast-forward to the year 2025, after my time at Pora tech, it was time to advance in my career. I sought help on LinkedIn from experienced professionals and got links to free advanced ethical hacking courses. I started with one of the courses on web-security and it got to a point where I was confused and fought hard to understand most things. I quickly reached out to one of my mentors who adviced that I drop everything and go learn Web development.
                        Fortunately, I came across the UPSKILL program flyer and saw it as a great opportunity to understand web development for free. I wasted no time to enroll and now I am here.
                    </p>
                    <p> My journey at the UPSKILL program has been exciting and I can't wait to see what the future holds.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, that's about it concerning my Tech Journey. Tell me about yours.</p>
